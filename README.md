## GoPoint

The GoPoint is a user-friendly interface that allows you to launch preselected demonstrations included in
the Linux Board Support Package (BSP) that NXP provides.

The GoPoint is for the ones who are interested in showcasing various features and capabilities of the SoCs
provided by NXP. The demos included in this application are meant to be easy to run for users of all skill levels,
making complex use cases accessible to anyone. Users need some knowledge when it comes to setting up equipment on
Evaluation Kits (EVKs), such as changing Device Tree Blob (DTB) files.

More information about the demos included in this package can be found at [DEXPUG.pdf](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/DEXPUG.pdf).
